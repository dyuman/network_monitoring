# This configuration is meant to be run every 1 hour from cron, on Ravemill Pi (it expects that Pi has ip 192.168.1.51)
# --> It does not print anything on the terminal while testing
# --> It tests connection only to the nodes in network map file, which have "192.168.1.51" written next to them
# --> It does speed test only, no ping
# --> It repeats each speedtest 2 times
# (basically this file does only an internet speed test)
