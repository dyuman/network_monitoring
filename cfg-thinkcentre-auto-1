# This configuration is meant to be run every 10 minutes from cron, on Thinkcentre (it expects that Thinkcentre has ip 10.56.130.10)
# --> It does not print anything on the terminal while testing
# --> It tests connection only to the nodes in network map file, which have "10.56.130.10" written next to them
# --> It does both ping and speedtest (where applicable)
# --> It repeats each test 20 times

# Default settings
cnf_verbose=0 # Display test information on stdout also
cnf_only_one_hop=1 # Test only to directly neighboring nodes
cnf_repeat_count=20 # How many times to repeat the tests
cnf_run_ping=1 # Whether to conduct ping test
cnf_run_speedtest=1 # Whether to conduct speed test

cnf_map_file="/home/janastu/network_monitoring/network_map.csv" # CSV file containing the network map
cnf_my_ip="10.56.130.10" # This node's ip
cnf_log_folder="/var/www/html/network-monitoring/${cnf_my_ip}-log" # Folder where to save logs. Make sure the directory exists!
cnf_ping_internet_ip="8.8.8.8" # ip to ping when doing ping test to internet
