# This configuration is meant to be run manually when needed, on Ravemill Pi (it expects that Pi has ip 192.168.1.51)
# --> It prints real time information on the terminal screen while testing
# --> It tests connection only to the nodes in network map file, which have "192.168.1.51" written next to them
# --> It does both ping and speed test (where applicable)
# --> It repeats each test 2 times
